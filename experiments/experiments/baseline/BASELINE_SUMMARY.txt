REPRODUCIBILITY:
  Logistic Regression: ✓ VERIFIED
  Random Forest:       ✓ VERIFIED

PERFORMANCE:
  LR Test F1:  0.3437
  RF Test F1:  0.3647
  Improvement: +0.0210 (+6.1%)

RECOMMENDATIONS:
  [WARNING] ⚠️  LR F1 (0.3437) < 0.65 → Investigate data quality or feature engineering
    Action: Investigate data quality and feature engineering

  [INFO] ⚠️  RF F1 (0.3647) < 0.75 (IEEE benchmark) → Investigate, do NOT discard
    Action: Investigate model performance but continue with current model

  [WARNING] ⚠️  RF improvement (0.0210, 6.1%) < 5pp → Feature interactions may be missing
    Action: Consider adding interaction features or polynomial terms
